# Wifi_Hacking-1
We access the handshake file using wireshark to open up the package by searching for its authentication protocol over the lan.<br>
We find the protocol(from the protocols wireshark has captured) in which the identities are shared.<br>
After opening up the handshake we identify the wpa key data which was exchanged between the two adapters, we need to crack it in order to get the  password.<br>
These commands were used on kali accessing the wordlist in rockyou.txt to bruteforce the password:<br>
Command aircrack -ng <handshake_filename> -w /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt<br>
The result of the brute force will give u the password that we seek for the secret wifi<br>
