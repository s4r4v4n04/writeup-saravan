# Wifi_Hacking-1
We access the handshake file using wireshark to open up the package by searching for its authentication protocol over the lan.
We find the protocol(from the protocols wireshark has captured) in which the identities are shared.
After opening up the handshake we identify the wpa key data which was exchanged between the two adapters, we need to crack it in order to get the          password.
These commands were used on kali accessing the wordlist in rockyou.txt to bruteforce the password:
Command aircrack -ng <handshake_filename> -w /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt
The result of the brute force will give u the password that we seek for the secret wifi
